# Post-Quantum Cryptography Assessment for Azure

## When to Use
- When assessing an Azure environment for quantum readiness
- When building a Cryptographic Bill of Materials for Azure resources
- When identifying classical cryptographic algorithms that need migration
- When planning post-quantum migration for Key Vault keys and certificates
- When evaluating TLS configurations for quantum vulnerability

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Harvest Now Decrypt Later | Attack where adversaries collect encrypted traffic today and decrypt it when quantum computers become available |
| Shor's Algorithm | Quantum algorithm that can break RSA and ECC by solving integer factorisation and discrete logarithm problems efficiently |
| ML-KEM | Module Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism, NIST FIPS 203, post-quantum safe key exchange |
| ML-DSA | Module Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm, NIST FIPS 204, post-quantum safe signing |
| SLH-DSA | Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm, NIST FIPS 205, post-quantum safe signing |
| CBOM | Cryptographic Bill of Materials, inventory of all cryptographic assets in a system |
| PQMA | Post-Quantum Migration Analyser, tool for validating PQC migration paths |

## OpenShield PQC Rules

| Rule | Description | Severity |
|------|-------------|----------|
| AZ-PQC-001 | TLS below 1.3 on App Service | HIGH |
| AZ-PQC-002 | Key Vault key using RSA or ECC algorithm | HIGH |
| AZ-PQC-003 | Key Vault certificate using non-quantum-safe signature algorithm | MEDIUM |

## Assessment Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Classical Keys in Key Vault
```bash
az keyvault list --output table
az keyvault key list --vault-name <vault-name> --output table
az keyvault certificate list --vault-name <vault-name> --output table
```

### Step 2: Check TLS Configuration on App Services
```bash
az webapp list --output table
az webapp config show --resource-group <rg> --name <app-name> --query minTlsVersion
```

### Step 3: Build Cryptographic Bill of Materials
Document all findings with resource ID, algorithm type, key size, expiry date, and dependent services.

### Step 4: Prioritise Migration
1. Keys and certificates exposed to internet traffic first
2. Long-lived keys with high blast radius second
3. Internal service-to-service encryption third

## NIST PQC Standards Reference

| Standard | Algorithm | Use Case |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| FIPS 203 | ML-KEM | Key encapsulation, replacing RSA and ECDH key exchange |
| FIPS 204 | ML-DSA | Digital signatures, replacing RSA-PSS and ECDSA |
| FIPS 205 | SLH-DSA | Digital signatures, hash-based alternative |

## NCSC UK PQC Migration Guidance

The UK National Cyber Security Centre requires organisations to treat PQC migration as a multi-year technology programme. Complete cryptographic discovery, define migration goals, and produce an initial plan by 2028. Complete the highest-priority migrations and refine the roadmap by 2031. Complete migration across systems, services, and products by 2035.

Key requirements:

- Maintain a complete inventory of systems and services that depend on public-key cryptography.
- Prioritise services that protect critical, sensitive, or long-lived data.
- Record supplier, protocol, hardware, and trust-chain dependencies.
- Build cryptographic agility into transition designs and plan for classical and PQC mechanisms to coexist temporarily.
- Use standards-compliant implementations from trusted libraries and products instead of creating custom algorithms.

Guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/pqc-migration-timelines

## ENISA Post-Quantum Cryptography Recommendations

ENISA recommends preparing protocols and systems for PQC integration before cryptographically relevant quantum computers arrive. Migration planning must consider application-specific trade-offs, protocol changes, interoperability, and the operational cost of replacing established public-key infrastructure.

Key requirements:

- Assess each cryptographic use case and its confidentiality or authenticity lifetime.
- Make new protocols and major protocol revisions PQC-aware.
- Consider hybrid implementations that add post-quantum protection to established classical mechanisms during transition.
- Evaluate algorithm families, parameter choices, implementation maturity, and performance for each workload.
- Preserve defence in depth and avoid weakening current security while adding quantum resistance.

## Harvest Now Decrypt Later Risk Assessment

Harvest Now Decrypt Later attacks capture encrypted information today so that an adversary can retain it until a quantum computer can break the classical key establishment. The risk exists before a cryptographically relevant quantum computer is available because collection can already be under way.

Assess HNDL risk using:

- The sensitivity and useful lifetime of encrypted data.
- Internet exposure and the feasibility of passive traffic collection.
- Whether RSA, finite-field Diffie-Hellman, or elliptic-curve key establishment protects the session.
- Key reuse, key age, certificate lifetime, and the blast radius of compromise.
- Dependencies on suppliers, protocols, hardware security modules, and certificate authorities.
- The time required to discover, test, deploy, and validate a replacement.

OpenShield marks internet-facing App Service TLS findings as directly HNDL-exposed. Key assets are also marked exposed when they may protect stored or transmitted data. Certificate-only signature risks are tracked separately because their primary quantum threat is authentication or signature forgery.
