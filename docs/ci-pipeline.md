# CI Pipeline

OpenShield runs GitHub Actions on every pull request to `dev` and `main`. The pipeline is split into **parallel, independent jobs** so total wall-time is the slowest single job rather than the sum of all checks. A change cannot merge until every required job passes.

This document explains each job, how to reproduce every check locally before opening a PR, the branch-protection model, and the reasoning behind the tools chosen.

## Jobs at a glance

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` (runs on PRs to `dev` and `main`):

| Job | Gate | What fails it |
|---|---|---|
| **Lint (ruff)** | `ruff check` + `ruff format --check` | Any lint violation or unformatted file |
| **Rule & Compliance Validation** | 7 static checks (below) | Rule/playbook/compliance-JSON problems |
| **Secret Scan (Gitleaks)** | `gitleaks detect` | A hardcoded secret in the working tree |
| **SAST (Bandit)** | `bandit -r api/ scanner/ ai/ -ll` | A medium+ severity insecure-code pattern |
| **SAST (Semgrep)** | `semgrep scan --config p/security-audit --config p/owasp-top-ten --config p/python --config p/javascript --error` | A finding from the security-audit / OWASP Top 10 / Python / JS rulesets |
| **SCA (pip-audit)** | `pip-audit -r requirements.txt` | A dependency with a known CVE (minus documented ignores) |
| **SBOM (Syft)** | CycloneDX SBOM generated + uploaded as an artifact | SBOM generation error |
| **Container Scan (Trivy)** | Dormant scaffold — skips until a `Dockerfile` exists (INFRA 1 / #154) | (nothing today) |
| **Backend Tests (pytest + coverage)** | Full `tests/` suite against an ephemeral Postgres, `--cov-fail-under=25` | A failing test or coverage below the floor |
| **Frontend (lint + build)** | `npm ci` → `eslint` → `vite build` | An eslint error or a broken dashboard build |
| **Enforce dev to main source** | `main` PRs must come from `dev` | A non-`dev` branch opening a PR into `main` |
| **CI Summary** | Aggregates all job results into the run summary and fails if any required job failed | Any required job failing |

`.github/workflows/codeql.yml` (separate workflow, PRs to `dev`/`main` + weekly cron): **Analyze (python)** and **Analyze (javascript)** — CodeQL semantic/taint analysis.

`.github/workflows/sbom-release.yml` (triggered `on: release: published`): generates a CycloneDX SBOM from the tagged code and uploads it to the GitHub Release assets.

The **Container Scan** job is intentionally **not** a required check yet: no `Dockerfile` exists, so it has nothing to scan. It activates automatically once INFRA 1 (#154) adds one.

## Setup for local runs

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install ruff bandit pip-audit semgrep  # lint / SAST / SCA tools
```

A local PostgreSQL is needed for the backend tests. Any Postgres 14+ works; create the CI-matching role/db once:

```bash
psql postgres -c "CREATE ROLE ci LOGIN PASSWORD 'ci';"
psql postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE ci_db OWNER ci;"
```

Gitleaks and Syft are single binaries (install via your package manager, e.g. `brew install gitleaks syft`, or download the release binary).

## Running each gate locally

Run these from the repo root. If a command exits non-zero, CI fails too.

### Lint (ruff)

```bash
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
```

Config lives in `pyproject.toml` (`line-length = 120`, rule set `E,F,W`, `target-version = py311`). To auto-fix: `ruff format .` then `ruff check --fix .`.

### Rule & Compliance Validation (7 checks)

```bash
# 1. Rule-file syntax
for f in scanner/rules/az_*.py; do python -m py_compile "$f"; done

# 2. Rule structure + RULE_ID uniqueness   (imports each rule module and checks attrs)
# 3. Hardcoded-credential grep
# 4. Playbook existence + `bash -n`
# 5. Compliance JSON validity
# 6. API/module syntax (api ai scanner sentinel)
# 7. Compliance-control -> rule-file cross-reference
```

Checks 2–7 are the same scripts embedded in the `rule-validation` job; copy them from `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run standalone. Their rationale is preserved in **Testing-method rationale** below.

### Secret Scan (Gitleaks)

```bash
gitleaks detect --source . --no-git -v --exit-code 1
```

`--no-git` scans the working tree (fast, PR-appropriate). Note it does **not** scan full git history — a secret committed and later removed within a branch's history is not caught here; GitHub's native push-protection (enabled at the repo level) is the second layer for that.

### SAST (Bandit)

```bash
bandit -r api/ scanner/ ai/ -ll
```

`-ll` reports medium severity and above. Confirmed false positives are annotated inline with `# nosec <ID>` and a one-line justification (e.g. binding `0.0.0.0` inside a container, a parameterized SQL string).

### SAST (Semgrep)

```bash
semgrep scan \
  --config p/security-audit \
  --config p/owasp-top-ten \
  --config p/python \
  --config p/javascript \
  --exclude venv --exclude frontend/node_modules --exclude frontend/dist \
  --metrics=off \
  --error .
```

Uses the public Semgrep Registry rulesets (`p/...`) directly, not `--config auto`, since `auto` nudges toward a semgrep.dev account/login, which this project deliberately avoids. `--metrics=off` disables Semgrep's anonymous telemetry. `venv/`, `node_modules/`, and `dist/` are already excluded by Semgrep's built-in default ignores and this repo's `.gitignore`, so no `.semgrepignore` is needed; the `--exclude` flags above just make that exclusion visible in the command itself. In CI, findings are also written to SARIF and uploaded to the GitHub Security → Code scanning tab alongside CodeQL's results.

### SCA (pip-audit)

```bash
pip-audit -r requirements.txt \
  --ignore-vuln PYSEC-2025-217 --ignore-vuln CVE-2026-1839 --ignore-vuln CVE-2026-4372
```

The three ignores are advisories in `transformers` (a transitive dependency of `sentence-transformers`) with no non-breaking fix available yet; they are tracked for a coordinated ML-stack bump rather than silently dropped.

### Backend Tests (pytest + coverage)

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://ci:ci@localhost/ci_db" OPENSHIELD_ENV="testing" \
  pytest tests/ -v --tb=short --cov=api --cov=scanner --cov-report=term --cov-fail-under=25
```

Runs the **entire** `tests/` suite once (not just rule tests). Tests requiring a vector store or an AI API key skip cleanly. `--cov-fail-under=25` is a floor to prevent backsliding; raise it as coverage grows.

### Frontend (lint + build)

```bash
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run lint && npm run build
```

## Branch protection and the promotion flow

The branch flow is `feature/* → dev → main`. Protection is applied to the two **destinations**; feature branches stay unprotected for fast iteration.

```
feat/* fix/* docs/*   ──PR──▶  dev   ──PR──▶  main  ──▶ production environment
   (unprotected)          (gate)        (stricter gate)
```

- **`dev`** — requires all CI checks above + CodeQL, 1 approving review, and "branches up to date before merging".
- **`main`** — everything `dev` requires, plus stricter review (2 approvals / code owners), `enforce_admins`, and the **Enforce dev to main source** check, which blocks any PR into `main` whose source branch is not `dev`. (To permit emergency hotfixes straight to `main`, widen that job's condition to also accept `hotfix/*`.)
- **`production` environment** — required reviewers with "prevent self-review", so a `dev → main` deployment cannot be approved by its own author.

CI runs at **both** merge points (`on: pull_request` targets `dev` and `main`), so the same gates apply on the way into `dev` and again, stricter, on the way into `main`.

---

## Tooling decisions

- **Gitleaks via the release binary, not `gitleaks-action`.** The Action requires a (free) `GITLEAKS_LICENSE` for **organization**-owned repos; the CLI binary is Apache-2.0 with no key, so it runs with zero license friction.
- **All third-party actions are pinned to a full commit SHA** with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment (GitHub's supply-chain hardening standard). `aquasecurity/trivy-action` is SHA-pinned specifically because its mutable tags were compromised in 2026.
- **Dependabot is notify-only** (`open-pull-requests-limit: 0` for pip / github-actions / npm): it still raises alerts but does not auto-open version-bump PRs.
- **Least-privilege token:** `ci.yml` declares `permissions: contents: read`; CodeQL and Semgrep each scope their own `security-events: write`.
- **`concurrency` cancels superseded runs** on the same PR to save runner minutes.
- **Semgrep added as a second, open-source SAST layer**, run as a pure CLI invocation (`semgrep scan --config p/...`) with `--metrics=off`, no semgrep.dev account, login, or telemetry dependency. It complements CodeQL's deeper data-flow/taint analysis with fast, pattern-based rules (OWASP Top 10, general security-audit, Python/JS-specific), uploading SARIF to the same GitHub code scanning UI. Added per maintainer direction to reduce reliance on GitHub's proprietary, soon-to-be-paid "Code Quality" product in favor of open-source tooling.
- **The `p/...` rulesets are pulled from the public Semgrep Registry at run time**, not vendored, so a registry outage fails the `SAST (Semgrep)` job. Accepted as a normal SAST-gate network dependency; a spurious red on that job is worth checking against Semgrep Registry status before assuming a real finding.

## Testing-method rationale

### Why `py_compile` for syntax, not a linter
`py_compile` has a binary, objective outcome (does the file parse?). Style linting is now handled separately and explicitly by **ruff**, so the syntax checks stay narrowly scoped to "will this import at all".

### Why `importlib` (not regex) for structure validation
A rule's fields may be computed, inherited, or split across lines. `spec_from_file_location` + `exec_module` + `hasattr()` is the only way to be certain an attribute exists at runtime — the same mechanism the scan engine uses to load rules, so CI mirrors production.

### Why `bash -n` for playbooks
It parses a `.sh` without executing it, catching unclosed `if`/`fi`, bad heredocs, and quoting errors at zero risk of touching an Azure resource. Existence alone is insufficient — a broken playbook crashes when an operator runs it against a real finding.

### Why the credential grep uses exclusions, not an allowlist
`password=`, `secret=`, `api_key=` appear legitimately in env-var lookups and comments, which are excluded; the scan targets literal assignment (the hardcoded-value pattern). Every exclusion is visible in one place and auditable. `venv/` is excluded so local runs don't false-positive on third-party packages.

### Why the cross-reference walks compliance JSONs
It catches the deletion case: a rule file removed but its compliance-JSON entry left behind. Walking the JSONs and looking up each referenced rule ID against existing rule files surfaces stale references with the exact file and ID.

---

## The CI summary

The `ci-summary` job uses `needs: [...]` + `if: always()` so it runs after every other job regardless of outcome, reads each job's `result`, and writes a markdown pass/fail table to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` (rendered on the Actions run page). A final step fails the job if any **required** job failed — Container Scan is excluded from that gate until it has an image to scan.

## Fixing common failures

| Failure | Fix |
|---|---|
| `ruff check` / `format` fails | `ruff format .` then `ruff check --fix .`; re-run both |
| `bandit` medium+ finding | Fix it, or if a confirmed false positive add `# nosec <ID>` with a one-line reason |
| `semgrep` finding | Fix the flagged pattern, or if a confirmed false positive add a `# nosemgrep: <rule-id>` (Python) / `// nosemgrep: <rule-id>` (JS) comment with a one-line justification on the flagged line |
| `pip-audit` reports a CVE | Bump the pin to a fixed version; only add `--ignore-vuln` with a documented reason |
| `pytest` coverage below 25% | Add tests, or investigate the regression that removed coverage |
| Frontend eslint error | Fix the reported rule (e.g. remove an unused import); warnings do not fail CI |
| `Enforce dev to main source` fails | Open the PR from `dev`; merge feature work into `dev` first |
| `missing field 'RULE_ID'` | Add `RULE_ID = "AZ-XXX-000"` at module level in the rule file |
| `DUPLICATE RULE_ID '...'` | Assign a unique ID to the newer rule file |
| `references '...' but no matching rule file found` | Create the rule file or remove the stale compliance-JSON entry |
